# **LPS_Layer**

This repository contains the code for computing the fraction of peptide to lipid ratios as a function of changing AMP concentrations. Due to the high precisions during the minimization, the running time can be very long. 

To see the complete result, please run the `generating_plots.py`. 

## **Reference**

The original code was provided by Shokoofeh Nourbakhsh from the paper [[Modeling the Protective Role of Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides against Membrane-Rupturing Peptides]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c02330).

Here, the code is modified to compute at larger peptide-brush attractive energy.
